This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

* `function1(head)`: this method is used to get the first element of array.
* `function2(tail)`: this method is used to create a new array that doesn't contain the first element of the original array.
* `function3(middle)`: this method is used to get the middle elements of array.
